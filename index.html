			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I , Cameron Dafoe, am an undergraduate student at the University of South Carolina majoring in Biological Sciences. Along with being a student, I am also here on scholarship for the swim team where I specialize in the individual medley. I am currently a personal touch volunteer at Prisma Health's Baptist location and I specifically work on the Oncology floor. As you can see, I run a very busy schedule in which helped me to develop a great skill in time management.</P>
			<p class="hidden" id="resultP1">Before I came to the University of South Carolina, I spent my freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh during the pandemic. In Pittsburgh, all classes were transferred to online instruction and students told to stay at home. I, being a student athlete still had to come live on campus. It felt as if I lived in a ghost town as the only people on the entire campus were a handful of sports teams. I learned very quickly that the teams aspirations did not align with mine since I desired to excell in both the classroom as well as the pool, whereas they just focused on swimming and let their grades slip up.</p>

			<h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
			<p> As I previously mentioned, I am majoring in Biological Sciences in which I plan on taking the medical school route. I specifically would like to be a surgeon, but I won't really know which specialty I would like to go into untill residency. In total I plan on taking four years in undergrad, 4 years in med school, and 7 years in residency before starting a 2 year fellowship in my desired specialty. It may seem like a very long road ahead, but as I have learned from swimming, I have a different kind of drive than the average student.</p>
			<p class="hidden" id="resultP2">As a pre medical student who also participates in athletics, I have had a very busy college experience. In my free time, I volunteer at the hospital in order to accumulate more clinical hours for my med school applications. Also, I am taking a MCAT prep course through blueprint which takes around 20 hours a week in order to get the ideal score of 520+ in order to make it to a dream med school of mine, UofSC Charleston. </p>
